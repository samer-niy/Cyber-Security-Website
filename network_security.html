    <section>
      <h3>1.1 Cyber security aims to protect information</h3>
      <p>Confidentiality - Information stored on a computer system/network must be protected against unintended or unauthor-ised access. Data confidentiality is a measure of the ability of a system to protect its data.</p>
      <p>Integrity - Integrity of data aims to protect data from unauthorised modification.</p>
      <p>Availability- Data/information stored on a computer system/network must be available to authorised users and organi-sations and be protected from unauthorised deletion. </p>
    </section>

      <h3>1.2 Types of cyber security incidents</h3>
      <p>•Unauthorised access – gaining access to computer systems, networks,programs and data without permission</p>
      <p>-hacking – illegally using a computer to access information stored on another computer system or to spread a virus </p>
      <p>-escalation of privileges – obtaining the rights to access and edit information that normal users do not normally have </p>
      <p>•Information disclosure – information passed to a person, organisation or state without the permission of the owner. </p>
      <p>•Modification of data – data that is entered, amended, stored or deleted without authorisation (can be accidental). </p>
      <p>•Inaccessible data – data that is not available to those with authorisation; it can be due to: </p>
      <p>-account lockout – the account is locked due to failed login attempts </p>
      <p>-denial of service (DoS) – an attack to shut down a computer system,network or website, making it inaccessible. </p>
      <p>•Destruction – permanent deletion of data through: </p>
      <p>-malware – software including viruses, worms, Trojan horses and spyware;used to steal, encrypt or delete sensitive data, alter or hijack computingfunctions or monitor users’ computer activity</p>
      <p>-deliberate erasure – data deleted from a computer system on purposeand without permission to cause problems for individuals, organisations and states</p>
      <p>•Theft – stealing computer-based information from an unknown victim with theintent of compromising privacy or obtaining confidential information.</p>

      <h3>1.3 The importance of cyber security</h3>
      <p>Cyber security is important to protect:</p>
      <p>•personal data (for example financial data, identity)</p>
